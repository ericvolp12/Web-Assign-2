1a.:A %%10,15,1%% inch radius medicine ball (it is a solid sphere) has a mass of %%10,20,1%% kg, and it is thrown with a linear velocity %%10,20,1%% m/s, and it is rotating at a rate of %%500,1000,0%% rpm. What is the angular momentum of this system?::kg m<sup>2</sup>/s:;
1b.:What is the rotational kinetic energy of this ball?::Joules:;
1c.:What percentage of the total kinetic energy of the ball is rotational KE?::percent:;
2a.:A car is designed to store energy in a large rotating disk that has a mass of %%30,45,1%% kg and a radius of %%20,40,0%% cm. The car is going %%15,30,1%% m/s when the intersection light turns red and the car must stop. If all the translational energy of the $$1200,1400,0$$ kg car is transferred to the disk at a red light, what would be the angular velocity of the disk? (the mass of the car does not include the mass of the disk).::rpm:;
2b.:What if the flywheel in the above problem was constructed so that all of the mass was located on the outer rim, so that it was the shape of a hoop and not a solid disk. Calculate the new angular velocity for this case.::rpm:;
3a.:A merry-go-round consists of a solid 400 kg. platform with a radius of 1.5 m. Four children are standing on the outer edge of the merry go round, and they each have a mass of 46 kg. The entire system is rotated at a rate of 7 rpm. What is the rotational inertia for this system? ::kg m<sup>2</sup>:
